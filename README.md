# 🚆 RAILVIEW – AI-Based Laser QR Code Marking on Track Fittings
# SMART INDIA HACKATHON 2025 | Team: Tech Voyager | PS ID: SIH25021 (HARDWARE) | Theme: Transportation & Logistics – Ministry of Railways

📌 Project Overview

RAILVIEW is an AI-enabled system for laser QR code marking and predictive maintenance of Indian Railways track fittings (Elastic Rail Clips, liners, fasteners, etc.).

It ensures:

Traceability of all components
Defect detection & predictive maintenance
Vendor accountability & comparison
Digital twin creation for each fitting
This project is under the Transportation & Logistics theme of the Ministry of Railways for Smart India Hackathon 2025.

🛠️ Problem Statement – Current Challenges

Currently, Indian Railways faces:

1. Limited traceability of track fittings — manual records are error-prone.
2. Delayed defect detection — cracks, rust, or deformation often go unnoticed until failure.
3. Lack of vendor accountability — hard to track which vendors supply reliable components.
4. High maintenance costs due to reactive inspection methods.
5. No digital record / mapping — no centralized system for inspection history and component data.

💡 Proposed Solution – RAILVIEW

RAILVIEW solves these problems by:

1. Laser-Based QR Marking
   
Permanent, durable QR codes engraved on track fittings.
Resistant to dust, rust, ballast impact, and weather conditions.

2. One-Time Scan & Digital Twin Creation
 
Each fitting scanned once → unique digital twin with UID, vendor, batch, material, warranty, and history.
Updated automatically with inspections and maintenance logs.

3. Mapping System with Pop-Ups
 
GIS-based track mapping.
Clicking on a track segment → pop-up shows details of all QR-marked fittings.

4. Vendor Comparison & Analysis
 
Tracks failure rates, durability, and defects per vendor.
Enables data-driven procurement decisions.

5. AI-Based Predictive Analysis
 
Predicts Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of fittings using historical + real-time data.
Provides early warnings for proactive replacement.

6. Defect Detection & Alerts
 
Detects cracks, rust, bending, missing clips via AI vision system.
Sends real-time alerts on the RAILVIEW dashboard.
